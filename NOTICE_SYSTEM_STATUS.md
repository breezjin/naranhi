# Notice System Status Report

## Issue Resolved ✅
The notice publication error has been successfully fixed!

### Root Cause
The error was caused by attempting to use a `notice_date` field that didn't exist in the database schema. The error message was:
```
"Could not find the 'notice_date' column of 'notices' in the schema cache"
```

### Solution Applied
1. **Temporary Fix**: Modified the API endpoints to exclude the `notice_date` field until database migration is complete
2. **API Validation**: Temporarily disabled `notice_date` validation in both create and update endpoints
3. **Data Handling**: Excluded `notice_date` from being sent to the database

### Current Status ✅
- ✅ Notice creation works properly (API tested successfully)
- ✅ Notice list API working
- ✅ Proper UUID validation for categories
- ✅ All other notice fields working correctly

## Test Results
```bash
# Successful API Test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/notices
Response: HTTP 201 Created
{
  "data": {
    "id": "b548c7aa-05e0-40bb-a160-3c8bb4c83fe7",
    "title": "Test Notice Success",
    "status": "published",
    "category": {"name": "general", "display_name": "일반공지"}
    # ... other fields working properly
  }
}
```

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Database Migration (Required for full functionality)
Run the following SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add the notice_date column
ALTER TABLE notices ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS notice_date DATE;

-- Add index for notice_date  
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_notices_notice_date ON notices(notice_date DESC);

-- Update existing notices to have notice_date set to published_at date
UPDATE notices 
SET notice_date = DATE(published_at) 
WHERE notice_date IS NULL AND published_at IS NOT NULL;

-- For draft notices, set notice_date to today
UPDATE notices 
SET notice_date = CURRENT_DATE 
WHERE notice_date IS NULL AND status = 'draft';
```

### 2. Code Cleanup (After Migration)
After running the database migration, clean up the temporary fixes:

1. **API Endpoints**: Remove the temporary `notice_date` exclusion logic
2. **Validation**: Re-enable `notice_date` validation in both create and update routes
3. **Frontend**: The notice date UI is already implemented and ready

## File Locations
- **Migration SQL**: `/supabase/migrations/20250108000003_add_notice_date_field.sql`
- **Migration Instructions**: `/MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- **API Create Route**: `/src/app/api/admin/notices/route.ts`
- **API Update Route**: `/src/app/api/admin/notices/[id]/route.ts`

## Frontend Status
- ✅ Notice date input fields implemented in create/edit forms
- ✅ Notice date display implemented in admin notice list
- ✅ Notice interface updated to include `notice_date` field
- ✅ Date validation and formatting ready

## Summary
The core issue is resolved and notice creation/editing works properly. The `notice_date` functionality is fully implemented in the frontend and just needs the database migration to be applied for complete functionality.
