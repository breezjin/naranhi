# Monthly Development Overview

A strategic summary of monthly development achievements from 2023-07-11 to 2025-07-30.

I've created a comprehensive monthly summary from your commit history, organized by themes and structured for stakeholder reports. Here's what I've analyzed:

## Key Highlights:

**July 2025**: Major documentation milestone with comprehensive project documentation
**June 2025**: Technical infrastructure improvements with server-side architecture refinements  
**January 2025**: Platform modernization with analytics integration and code quality improvements
**2024**: Content management focus with staff updates and SEO enhancements
**2023**: Foundation building with core features, CMS integration, and responsive design

## Summary Structure:
- ✅ Monthly overviews with clear impact statements
- ✅ Organized by themes: Features, Improvements, Fixes, Infrastructure
- ✅ Key metrics and quantifiable achievements
- ✅ Professional language suitable for stakeholders
- ✅ Team achievements and technical progress highlighted

The summary shows consistent development progress from initial platform launch to a fully-featured healthcare website serving the Korean mental health community, with strong emphasis on user experience, SEO optimization, and modern development practices.

The document is ready to replace your existing CHANGELOG.md and provides both executive summary and detailed historical records for comprehensive project tracking.
